# ADR 000 — Phase 1 planning decisions

Status: Accepted (Aadi, 20 Oct 2026: "Plan approved")

## Context

`docs/PLAN.md` §8 listed nine open questions with recommendations. Aadi approved the plan as written.

## Decisions

| Q   | Decision                                                                                                     |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Q1  | Infra track (#2–#5) runs while contracts #6 waits for G1                                                     |
| Q2  | D1–D8 checkpoint moves to 24 Oct 18:00; VPS #25 cut unless checkpoint lands by 24 Oct 12:00                  |
| Q3  | Secret Detection, SAST and IaC scan jobs land in #2 (not #22)                                                |
| Q4  | Third upstream = GitLab MCP with a dedicated fine-grained PAT (MCP tool: Execute); fallback DeepWiki no-auth |
| Q5  | Dashboard login = email + password (scrypt), admin-created members, admin seeded from a Secret               |
| Q6  | External MCP endpoint = `POST /mcp`, stateless Streamable HTTP, Bearer key checked per request               |
| Q7  | Chat model = Claude Sonnet (latest)                                                                          |
| Q8  | GitHub copy via GitLab push-mirror to a public GitHub repo, set up 26 Oct                                    |
| Q9  | Canary (#23) runs on ephemeral k3d inside CI; fallback a project runner on the Mac                           |

## Alternatives

Recorded per question in `docs/PLAN.md` §8.

## Consequences

Q5 and Q6 are fixed in the #6 contracts MR (G1). Q4 and Q7 need Aadi to supply `GITLAB_MCP_TOKEN` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.local` by 23 Oct.
