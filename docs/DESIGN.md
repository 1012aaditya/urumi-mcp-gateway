# Design

Requirements R3, W4, G3 (`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`). Decisions are recorded in
[ADR 000](adr/000-phase1-decisions.md) (planning choices), [ADR 001](adr/001-contracts.md)
(contracts: API, naming, auth, schema) and [ADR 002](adr/002-upstreams.md) (upstreams 2 and 3).
Security analysis: [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md). Every statement below names the file
that implements it.

| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## 2. Request flows: one call path

Both ways of running a tool end in the same function, `callTool(userId, qualifiedName, args,
{ source, apiKeyId })` (`apps/gateway/src/core/call-tool.ts`), created once in
`apps/gateway/src/server.ts` and shared by the MCP endpoint and the chat service. Its
`onCallFinished` hook writes the audit row (`apps/gateway/src/audit/hook.ts`) in a `finally`
block, so no path can skip it.

```

**External MCP endpoint** (`apps/gateway/src/mcp/endpoint.ts`). `POST /mcp`, stateless
Streamable HTTP with JSON responses and no `Mcp-Session-Id` (ADR 001). The bearer key is checked
in `onRequest`, before the 1 MB body is read. Each request gets a fresh SDK `McpServer` bound to
the key's user, so a revoked key fails on its very next request. A `GatewayError` from
`callTool` becomes an `isError` tool result carrying the error envelope. `GET`/`DELETE` → 405.
Upstream `instructions` are never forwarded.

**Chat** (`apps/gateway/src/chat/service.ts`, `routes.ts`). The browser resends the
conversation (≤ 40 messages, ≤ 8000 chars each by contract; ≤ 64 KB total, checked in
`checkHistory`). The gateway runs one Anthropic Messages tool loop with the registry's current
tool set and calls `callTool(sessionUser.id, …, { source: 'chat' })` for every `tool_use`. It
returns the reply plus `toolCalls` (name, server, outcome, duration, error code), which the
dashboard lists under **Tools used** (`apps/dashboard/src/pages/Chat.tsx`).

| Chat limit                    | Value                                     | Where                             |

| Model                         | `CHAT_MODEL`, default `claude-sonnet-5-5` | `chat/service.ts`, `values*.yaml` |

| Requests per user             | 20 per sliding minute → 429               | `chat/rate-limit.ts`              |
| No API key                    | `POST /api/chat` → 503                    | `chat/routes.ts`                  |

The system prompt (`systemPrompt()`) is fixed text plus the user's email and the current IST
time; no upstream content ever goes into it. Tool descriptions travel only as tool definitions
and results only as `tool_result` blocks.

## 3. Data model

`packages/contracts/sql/001_init.sql` … `007_stores.sql` (one file per feature: tool permissions,
scaling, observability, OAuth, hosted servers, stores), applied on gateway start by
`apps/gateway/src/db/migrate.ts` (advisory lock, `schema_migrations` table, idempotent).

```mermaid
erDiagram
  users ||--o{ sessions : has
  users ||--o{ api_keys : owns
  users ||--o{ audit_log : "acted as"
  api_keys |o--o{ audit_log : "used by (mcp)"
  users {
    uuid id PK
    text email UK "lowercase"
    text role "admin | member"
    text password_hash "scrypt"
    timestamptz disabled_at
  }
  sessions {
    text id PK "sha256 hex of cookie token"
    uuid user_id FK
    timestamptz expires_at
  }
  api_keys {
    uuid id PK
    uuid user_id FK
    text prefix "first 8 chars"
    bytea key_hash UK "sha256"
    timestamptz last_used_at
    timestamptz revoked_at
  }
  upstreams {
    uuid id PK
    text slug UK "immutable"
    text url
    boolean enabled
    text credential_type "none | bearer | header"
    bytea credential_ciphertext "AES-256-GCM"
    text status "unknown | up | down"
    text last_error
  }
  audit_log {
    bigint id PK
    uuid user_id FK
    uuid api_key_id FK "null for chat"
    text source "mcp | chat"
    text server_slug "text, not FK"
    text tool
    timestamptz started_at
    integer duration_ms
    text outcome "ok | error | timeout | denied | rate_limited"
    text error_code
  }
```

- A CHECK (`upstreams_credential_complete`) keeps the ciphertext, IV, tag and header-name columns
  consistent with `credential_type`.
- `audit_log.server_slug` is plain text, so deleting an upstream keeps its audit history.
- OAuth (ADR 013, `005_oauth.sql`): `oauth_clients` (DCR), `oauth_auth_requests` (pending
  consent, 10 min), `oauth_grants` (one per approval = a connected app = a token family, with
  `revoked_at` / `revoke_reason`), `oauth_codes` (60 s, single use), `oauth_tokens` (access /
  refresh, sha256 only), and `audit_log.oauth_grant_id` (at most one of it and `api_key_id`).
- The first admin is created from `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` only when no admin
  exists (`apps/gateway/src/db/seed.ts`); it never updates an existing user.

## 4. Store connectivity (W4): REST API + Application Password

woo-mcp talks to WooCommerce only through its REST API (`/wp-json/wc/v3`,
`apps/woo-mcp/src/woo-client.ts`, 10 s timeout per request) as a dedicated WordPress user
`woo-mcp` with role `shop_manager`, authenticated by an Application Password. The bootstrap Job
(`charts/platform/files/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh`, `publish-secret.sh`) creates the user and
password and publishes them only into Secret `urumi-woo-api` (`WOO_URL`, `WOO_USER`,
`WOO_APP_PASSWORD`), then verifies `GET /wp-json/wc/v3/orders` returns 200.

In production WordPress is served over HTTPS but woo-mcp calls it in-cluster over plain HTTP, so
it sends `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` (`wooMcp.forwardedProto`) and can override the `Host` header
(`wooMcp.hostHeader`, `apps/woo-mcp/src/host-override-fetch.ts`).

woo-mcp's tools (`apps/woo-mcp/src/tools/`): `list_products`, `create_product`, `list_orders`,
`get_order`, `update_order_status`. "Today" for `list_orders` is the Asia/Kolkata calendar day
by `date_created` (`apps/woo-mcp/src/store-time.ts`).

## 5. Tool naming and collisions (G3)

Implemented in `packages/contracts/src/naming.ts`, applied in
`apps/gateway/src/core/registry.ts`.

- **Format** `{slug}__{tool}`, e.g. `woo__list_orders`, `everything__echo`. Two upstreams
  exposing the same tool name never collide because slugs are unique (DB `UNIQUE`) and part of
  the name.
- **Slug** `^[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]{0,18}[a-z0-9])?$`: 1–20 chars, no `_`, so the first `__` in a
  name always ends the slug and `parseQualifiedName` is unambiguous. Slugs are immutable
  (`UpdateUpstreamRequestSchema` is strict and has no `slug`), because they are in every tool
  name and audit row.
- **Sanitising** Tool characters outside `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` become `_`, so every name fits
  Claude's `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`.
- **Length** If `slug__tool` is over 64 chars, the tool part is truncated and suffixed with `_` +
  8 hex chars of FNV-1a 32-bit over the original tool name's UTF-8 bytes. FNV-1a is
  non-cryptographic; it only has to separate tools within one server and runs in the browser.
- **Routing never reverses sanitising.** The registry keeps qualified → original name per tool
  and `callTool` sends the original (`tool.originalName`).
- **Collisions within one upstream after sanitising** (`foo.bar` and `foo_bar`): the first one in
  the upstream's order is kept, the second is dropped with a warning log
  (`duplicate qualified tool name after sanitising`).
- The chat service additionally skips any tool whose name fails Claude's regex or whose
  `inputSchema.type` is not `object` (`toAnthropicTools`).
- **Reserved slug `gateway`** (ADR 012): the gateway's own meta-tools `gateway__search_tools` and
  `gateway__call_tool`; an upstream cannot be created with it.
- **Many tools: discovery mode** (ADR 012). `/mcp?mode=discovery` (or header
  `x-urumi-tool-mode: discovery`) lists only the two meta-tools: a BM25 keyword search over the
  caller's permitted tools, and a call that goes through `callTool` (permissions, timeout, audit
  of the real tool). The chat agent switches to it when a user's permitted tools exceed
  `CHAT_DISCOVERY_THRESHOLD` (default 40) and reports the real tools executed. D12 proves it on
  142 tools.

A health result is written only if the row's URL and credential did not change during the check
(`setUpstreamHealth`), so an admin edit is never overwritten by a stale result. The dashboard's
**Upstreams** page polls every 15 s. Measured by `tests/infra/upstreams.sh` (ADR 002): a killed
`everything` pod shows `down` after 12 s and `up` 18 s after it returns.

## 7. Authentication and roles (T1, T2)

**Dashboard sessions** (`apps/gateway/src/auth/session.ts`, `routes.ts`, `password.ts`).
Email + password, scrypt (N=16384, r=8, p=1, 16-byte salt). Login returns a random 32-byte token
in cookie `urumi_session` (`HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` when `COOKIE_SECURE=true`,
12 h). The DB stores only sha256 of the token. Every request re-reads the user, so disable, role
change and logout apply immediately; disabling a user also deletes their sessions; changing a
password deletes the user's other sessions. A Cookie header with two `urumi_session` values is
refused (cookie tossing). Login throttle (`auth/login-limiter.ts`, in memory): 10 attempts per
email and 30 failures per client IP per 15 min; a refusal looks exactly like a wrong password,
and unknown emails cost one scrypt like real ones.

**CSRF** (`apps/gateway/src/http/csrf.ts`). On every POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE except the `/mcp`
route and the cookie-less OAuth endpoints `/oauth/register`, `/oauth/token`, `/oauth/revoke`: a body must be `application/json` (cross-origin browsers need a preflight for that, which
is never granted) and a present `Origin` must equal `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`.

**Roles.** `requireAdmin` guards upstream create/edit/delete, member management, and other users'
keys. Members can list upstreams (without `url`), tools, their own keys, and their own audit rows
(`audit/routes.ts` replaces a member's `userId` filter with their own id). An admin cannot demote
or disable themselves, and the last active admin cannot be removed (row-locked,
`users/routes.ts`). There is no self-signup: admins create members and get a one-time
`tempPassword` (16 random bytes).

**Tool permissions** (ADR 008; `packages/contracts/src/permissions.ts`,
`apps/gateway/src/permissions/`, `core/visible-tools.ts`). Rules in `tool_permissions`
(role or user × server or `*` × tool / `prefix*` / `*` × allow/deny); a user's own rules override
the role's, the most specific rule wins, deny wins ties, and no match means deny. Default: admins
everything; members only read tools (`woo__list_products`, `woo__list_orders`, `woo__get_order`,
everything's harmless tools, GitLab `get_*` / `list_*` / search). Every tool list (MCP
`tools/list`, chat tool set, `/api/tools`, `/api/upstreams/:id/tools`) is filtered by
`listToolsFor(userId)`, and `callTool` rejects a disallowed name with `FORBIDDEN` before touching
the upstream, audited as `denied`. Admins edit rules at `/api/permissions` (dashboard
**Permissions**, with an effective-access preview using the same evaluator). Proven by D9.

**API keys** (`apps/gateway/src/auth/api-keys.ts`, `keys/`). `urk_` + base64url(32 random
bytes), returned once by `POST /api/keys`. The DB keeps sha256 (`key_hash`, unique) and an 8-char
`prefix` for display. Only the exact form `Bearer urk_<43 chars>` is looked up. A key is accepted
only if not revoked and its user is not disabled. Revoking sets `revoked_at` (own keys, or any
user's as admin); another user's key id answers 404. `last_used_at` is updated at most once a
minute, fire-and-forget.

**OAuth for MCP clients** (ADR 013; `apps/gateway/src/oauth/`, dashboard `Consent.tsx`,
`ConnectedApps.tsx`). The gateway is also an OAuth 2.1 authorization server, so a client given
only `http://app.localtest.me/mcp` can sign in through the browser instead of using a pasted key:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as MCP client
  participant G as Gateway
  participant B as Browser (dashboard)
  C->>G: POST /mcp (no token)
  G-->>C: 401 WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=".../.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp"
  C->>G: GET protected-resource + authorization-server metadata
  C->>G: POST /oauth/register (DCR: name, loopback redirect)
  C->>B: open /oauth/authorize?code_challenge(S256)&state&resource
  B->>G: GET /oauth/authorize → 302 /consent?request=…
  B->>G: (login if needed) GET /api/oauth/requests/:id → client name, redirect host, consent token
  B->>G: POST /api/oauth/requests/:id {approve, consentToken} → redirectTo (code, state, iss)
  B->>C: redirect to http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback?code…
  C->>G: POST /oauth/token (code + code_verifier) → access 1 h + refresh 30 d
  C->>G: POST /mcp Bearer uat_… → same path as API keys (listToolsFor, callTool, audit)
```

Clients registered with DCR (https or loopback redirect URIs only, rate limited); codes single
use, 60 s, bound to client + redirect + PKCE; refresh tokens rotate and reuse revokes the grant;
tokens opaque and stored as sha256. `/mcp` accepts `urk_` API keys or `uat_` access tokens and
both become a user id; the audit row records the OAuth grant (`authMethod: oauth`, client name).
**Connected apps** lists grants (members: own; admins: all) and disconnecting deletes their
tokens immediately. All state is in Postgres, so any replica serves any step.

## 8. Upstream credentials (G5)

- **Encryption** (`apps/gateway/src/crypto/secretbox.ts`): AES-256-GCM, fresh random 12-byte IV
  per write, 16-byte tag, AAD = the upstream's id, so a ciphertext copied to another row fails to
  open. Key: `GATEWAY_ENC_KEY` (base64 of exactly 32 bytes, validated in `config.ts`), from Secret
  `urumi-env`.
- **Use**: decrypted only in `upstreams/decrypt-for-call.ts`, just before an outbound request,
  and sent as `Authorization: Bearer …` or the configured header. Header names that the gateway
  controls (Host, Content-Type, `Mcp-*`, …) and CR/LF/NUL in values are rejected by the contracts
  schema (ADR 001).
- **Never returned**: `UpstreamSchema` is strict and exposes only `credentialType` /
  `hasCredential`; request bodies are not logged and `credential` paths are redacted
  (`LOGGER_OPTIONS` in `server.ts`).
- **Host change**: changing an upstream's URL to a different origin (scheme, host or port) while a
  credential is stored is refused unless the admin re-enters or removes the credential
  (`upstreams/routes.ts`), so a token cannot be redirected to a new server. Path-only changes keep
  it.
- **Seeding**: `tests/e2e/seed-upstreams.sh` reads `WOO_MCP_SHARED_SECRET` and `GITLAB_MCP_TOKEN`
  from the Kubernetes Secret and sends them once through the admin API; the gateway pod does not
  get `GITLAB_MCP_TOKEN` as an env var (ADR 002).

## 9. Audit (T3)

One `audit_log` row per `callTool` invocation, written before the caller gets the result
(`core/call-tool.ts` → `audit/hook.ts` → `audit/repo.ts`).

| Case                                                                   | `outcome`      | `error_code`                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Upstream returned a result                                             | `ok`           | null                                                         |
| Upstream returned `isError: true`                                      | `error`        | `UPSTREAM_ERROR`                                             |
| Upstream error, unreachable, result too large                          | `error`        | `UPSTREAM_ERROR` / `UPSTREAM_UNREACHABLE`                    |
| 15 s deadline passed                                                   | `timeout`      | `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`                                           |
| Unknown tool / unqualified name, disabled server, non-object arguments | `denied`       | `TOOL_NOT_FOUND` / `UPSTREAM_DISABLED` / `VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| Anything unexpected                                                    | `error`        | `INTERNAL`                                                   |
| `/mcp` request over the per-key / per-user limit (ADR 010)             | `rate_limited` | `RATE_LIMITED` (server `gateway`, tool `mcp`)                |

Each row has user, API key (MCP) or null (chat), source, server slug (`unknown` if the name did
not parse), the upstream's original tool name (capped at 200 chars), start time, duration,
outcome, error code and **error detail** (ADR 011): the fixed-vocabulary reason — `Timed out`,
`Host did not resolve`, `Connection failed (ECONNREFUSED)`, `HTTP 503`, `MCP error -32603`,
`Tool returned an error`, `Not permitted`, … — classified for the API (`errorReason`) and the
Health / Metrics page. Never upstream text.

**Not logged:** tool arguments and results (customer data, ADR 001); `tools/list` calls;
requests with a missing, revoked or unknown key (no user to attribute them to — they are a 401 in
the HTTP log only, so D5's rejected call has no audit row); Anthropic calls; admin actions such as
creating users, revoking keys or editing upstreams. If the audit insert fails, the tool result is
still returned and the row's fields go to the error log.

`GET /api/audit` is keyset-paginated (`started_at desc, id desc`) with filters for user, server,
tool, outcome and time range (`audit/repo.ts`); members only ever see their own rows.

## 10. Kubernetes layout

One chart, `charts/platform`; differences between local and VPS live only in `values-local.yaml`
and `values-prod.yaml` (README "Local → VPS").

| Workload           | Kind                                        | Probes                                                                  | Notes                                                                                                  |

| `urumi-woo-mcp`    | Deployment                                  | `/healthz`                                                              | 0 replicas until `urumi-woo-api` exists (`lookup`); NetworkPolicy: gateway pods only, 8080; no Ingress |

- **Requests and limits** on every container (`values.yaml`); `tests/infra/chart-checks.sh`
  renders both values files and fails if any Deployment/StatefulSet container lacks liveness,
  readiness, requests or limits, or if the chart renders a `Secret`.
- **Secrets**: the chart only references existing Secrets: `urumi-env` (from `.env.local` via
  `scripts/secrets-apply.sh`, or created out-of-band in prod) and `urumi-woo-api` (written by the
  bootstrap Job). Pods without API needs have `automountServiceAccountToken: false`.
- **Bootstrap RBAC** (`templates/bootstrap/rbac.yaml`): `get/patch/update` on Secret
  `urumi-woo-api` only; `create` on Secrets in the namespace (Kubernetes cannot scope `create` by
  name); `get/patch/update` on the `urumi-woo-mcp` Deployment and its scale. Only the Job's
  kubectl container gets a projected token.
- **NetworkPolicies** (ADR 009, `templates/networkpolicy/`, `networkPolicy.enabled`, on in both
  values files): a namespace-wide **default deny for ingress and egress**, DNS egress for every
  pod, and one allow per real flow — Traefik → dashboard / gateway (+ canary) / WordPress;
  gateway → Postgres, woo-mcp, everything, internet 80/443; woo-mcp → WordPress; WordPress →
  MariaDB (+ internet); bootstrap Job → MariaDB, WordPress, Kubernetes API, internet. "Internet"
  excludes private, CGNAT, link-local and loopback ranges. Postgres, MariaDB, everything and the
  dashboard have no egress. k3s's kube-router enforces them; `tests/infra/netpol-default-deny.sh`
  proves an unlabelled pod reaches nothing and a gateway-labelled pod reaches only its three
  backends (output in `docs/NETWORK_POLICIES.md`); `tests/infra/chart-checks.sh` fails if a
  workload has no allow policy.
- **Non-root**: every long-running container runs as a non-root uid. WordPress runs as www-data
  (33) with all capabilities dropped and binds port 80 through the safe pod sysctl
  `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=0` (`wordpress.runAsNonRoot`, ADR 009).
- **Several gateway replicas** (ADR 010, `gateway.replicas`): any replica serves any request —
  `/mcp` is stateless Streamable HTTP, and what replicas must agree on lives in Postgres: the `/mcp`
  token buckets (`rate_limit_buckets`, per key and per user, one atomic UPSERT per bucket, 429 +
  `Retry-After`, audited `rate_limited`) and the `health` lease (`gateway_leases`): only the
  holder runs the 15 s health loop and writes upstream status; followers read status from the
  row. Tool caches stay per replica (correctness comes from the row). D10 proves it on k3d.
- **Metrics** (ADR 011): each gateway pod serves Prometheus `GET /metrics` on internal port 9464
  (`tool_calls_total`, `tool_call_duration_seconds`, `upstream_up`, last-check/last-success
  timestamps, `rate_limited_total`, process metrics), exposed by Service
  `<release>-gateway-metrics` only — never by the Ingress — and admitted by NetworkPolicy only
  from pods labelled `urumi.io/metrics-scraper: "true"`. Per pod; sum over pods. Optional
  `ServiceMonitor` (off). The admin **Health / Metrics** page computes per-server calls, error
  rate and p50/p95 from `audit_log` (all replicas) and shows each upstream's classified last
  failure and last success.
- **Hosted MCP servers** (ADR 014, `templates/hosted/`, `hosted.enabled`, on in both values
  files): admins add an MCP server by container image (`POST /api/hosted-servers` or the
  dashboard's "Hosted (container image)" mode). The gateway's reconciler (`hosted/reconciler.ts`,
  under the Postgres lease `hosted`, so one writer across replicas) server-side-applies a
  Deployment, ClusterIP Service and optional env Secret `mcp-<slug>[-env]` in namespace
  `urumi-hosted`, from a pod template fixed in `hosted/manifests.ts` (non-root uid 65532,
  read-only root + `/tmp` emptyDir, no capabilities, seccomp RuntimeDefault, no SA token, preset
  requests/limits, TCP probes). When the pod is ready it enables the hosted upstream row
  (`http://mcp-<slug>.urumi-hosted.svc.cluster.local:<port><path>`) and checks it at once; status
  Deploying / Connected / Unreachable / Failed (with the pod's reason) is shown on the Upstreams
  page. The namespace enforces Pod Security `restricted`, a ResourceQuota + LimitRange, default
  deny with ingress only from the gateway, DNS egress, and internet egress only for servers created
  with `egress: true`. Images must match `hosted.allowedImages` (prefixes); digests are recorded
  and can be required (`hosted.requireDigest`, on in prod). The gateway's ServiceAccount has one
  Role, in `urumi-hosted`: deployments get/list/create/patch/delete, services and secrets
  create/patch/delete (no secret reads), pods get/list — checked by `tests/infra/hosted-chart.sh`.
  The gateway talks to the API with `node:https` + its projected token (no client library).
- **Multiple stores** (ADR 015, `templates/stores/`, `multiStore.enabled`, on in
  `values-local.yaml`, off in `values-prod.yaml`): admins create and delete extra WooCommerce
  stores on the **Stores** page (`POST /api/stores`: slug, name, admin email). The gateway's
  provisioner (`stores/provisioner.ts`, Postgres lease `stores`) creates namespace `store-<slug>`
  (Pod Security `restricted`, ResourceQuota + LimitRange, default-deny NetworkPolicies with only
  the store's own flows), MariaDB + WordPress with their PVCs, an Ingress for
  `<slug>.<multiStore.domainSuffix>`, generated passwords in create-once Secrets, the built-in
  store's bootstrap Job (same scripts, mounted into the gateway from the bootstrap ConfigMap), and
  — after the Job succeeded — a woo-mcp Deployment with its own shared secret. It then enables the
  store's upstream row (`http://woo-mcp.store-<slug>.svc.cluster.local/mcp`, tools `<slug>__*`)
  with the built-in store's member read-only defaults. Status Provisioning (with the step) / Ready
  / Failed (with the reason; Retry) / Deleting. Delete removes the namespace (volumes included),
  then the rules and the upstream. RBAC: a ClusterRole for namespaces + creating RoleBindings that
  may only reference two chart-defined ClusterRoles (`bind` by name), confined to `store-*`
  namespaces by a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy; checked by `tests/infra/stores-chart.sh`, proved by
  D15. Stores are runtime objects: Helm upgrades and rollbacks do not touch them (ADR 015).
- **SSRF allow-list**: `UPSTREAM_ALLOWED_HOSTS` defaults to exactly the chart's in-cluster
  upstream Services (`<release>-woo-mcp` and `<release>-everything` in the namespace,
  `templates/gateway/_pod.tpl`), so they pass the private-address check while Postgres, MariaDB
  and WordPress stay blocked. Hosted and store upstream rows may reach only their own computed
  Service host.

## 11. Tradeoffs and what we would do with more time

| Hosted servers: allow-list + digest   | No admission controller to install; works on any k3s  | No image signature check (cosign) or scan; egress is all-or-nothing internet (ADR 014)   |

With more time: terminate upstream MCP sessions (`DELETE`) after each operation; stream-cap
response bodies before parsing; audit admin actions; move the chat limit and login throttle to
the shared token buckets;
append-only audit role in Postgres; per-API-key scopes;
confirmation step for write tools in chat; KMS-backed or rotatable `GATEWAY_ENC_KEY`; the
e2e flows in CI (images are already built and pushed by CI); a real VPS run (#25).

**Known gap: upstream sessions are not terminated.** ADR 002 measured that server-everything
keeps every un-terminated session in memory (≈ 0.06 MiB each) and expected the fix in the
gateway client. `apps/gateway/src/mcp-client/upstream-client.ts` still calls only
`client.close()`, never `transport.terminateSession()`. With one health ping per 15 s plus calls,
the `everything` pod grows toward its 192 Mi limit (ADR 002 estimates an OOM kill about every 10
hours); Kubernetes restarts it and the health loop reports the gap.

## 12. Upgrades and rollback

One Helm release (`urumi`) holds every component, so every change — image, values, chart — is one
numbered revision (`helm history`). The same commands work locally and on a VPS; only the values
file differs.

**Upgrade.** `helm upgrade --install urumi charts/platform -n urumi -f <values> --wait`. What
happens per component:

| Component                                               | On upgrade                                                                                                                             | On `helm rollback <rev>`                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| gateway, dashboard, woo-mcp, everything                 | Deployment rolling update (new pod Ready before the old one goes)                                                                      | same rolling update back to the old pod template                              |
| WordPress                                               | `Recreate` (the docroot PVC is ReadWriteOnce): a few seconds without a storefront                                                      | same                                                                          |
| MariaDB, Postgres                                       | StatefulSet rolling update of pod 0; data stays on the `volumeClaimTemplates` PVC                                                      | pod spec only; **data is not rolled back**                                    |
| WordPress docroot PVC                                   | unchanged (`helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, also survives `helm uninstall`)                                                            | unchanged                                                                     |
| Gateway schema                                          | new `packages/contracts/sql/NNN_*.sql` files applied on start, once, under a Postgres advisory lock (`apps/gateway/src/db/migrate.ts`) | **not reverted** (no down-migrations): the old image runs on the newer schema |
| Store bootstrap (Job, `post-install,post-upgrade` hook) | re-runs after every install/upgrade; idempotent: checks state first, keeps a still-working Application Password, re-scales woo-mcp     | **does not run** (no `post-rollback` hook); the store keeps its state         |
| Secrets `urumi-env`, `urumi-woo-api`                    | never rendered by the chart; untouched                                                                                                 | untouched                                                                     |
| NetworkPolicies, RBAC, Ingress                          | created/updated/deleted to match the chart                                                                                             | restored to the old revision's set (verified: README "Upgrades and rollback") |
| Store namespaces `store-<slug>` (ADR 015)               | not Helm objects: untouched by the upgrade; the new gateway re-applies objects whose spec hash changed (e.g. a new woo-mcp image)      | untouched; without `multiStore` in the old revision they run unmanaged        |

**Rules that keep rollback safe.**

1. Migrations are additive (expand, then contract in a later release): add tables/columns with
   defaults, never drop or rename what the previous release reads. Then rolling the gateway back
   one revision is always safe; data written by the newer release is ignored, not lost.
2. The hook must stay idempotent and must not depend on running after a rollback.
3. Immutable fields — StatefulSet `volumeClaimTemplates` (storage size, class) and every
   `selector` — cannot change through `helm upgrade`. A PVC is resized with `kubectl patch pvc`
   on a StorageClass with `allowVolumeExpansion`; a selector change needs a new object name.
4. A failed upgrade (`--wait` timeout or failed hook) leaves the revision `failed`; recover with
   `helm rollback urumi <last deployed rev>` after reading `kubectl get events` and the failing pod's
   logs. `--atomic` would do this automatically but also hides the failed state, so it is not the
   default here.
5. Back up before risky upgrades: `kubectl -n urumi exec urumi-postgres-0 -- pg_dump -U gateway
gateway > gateway.sql` and `kubectl -n urumi exec urumi-mariadb-0 -- mariadb-dump …`. Restores
   are manual; there is no scheduled backup in the chart.

**Automated rollback of gateway releases (CI canary, ADR 003/005).** On `main`, the `canary` job
builds a throwaway k3d cluster, installs the last promoted commit as stable, seeds users and
today's orders, then deploys the new gateway image as `urumi-gateway-canary` with 20 % of `/api`
and `/mcp` (Traefik `IngressRoute`). `scripts/canary/verdict.py` sends real `woo__list_orders`
calls with a member's key and compares the tracks (error rate, p95 latency, tool success):

- **PROMOTE** → `scripts/canary/run.sh promote <tag>`: the stable image becomes the canary's tag
  and the canary is disabled (a Helm upgrade with `--reset-then-reuse-values --no-hooks`).
- **ROLLBACK** or **HOLD** → `scripts/canary/run.sh rollback`: the canary is disabled, stable is
  untouched; the job fails, which opens an incident and starts the Duo incident flow (ADR 007).
- A PROMOTE of a high-risk change is rolled back and waits for `release:human-approval`.

The canary only exercises the gateway; chart-wide changes (NetworkPolicies, StatefulSets) are
verified by the e2e suite on the local cluster and rolled back with `helm rollback`.
